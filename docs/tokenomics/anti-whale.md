# Anti-Whale Mechanisms

WallyBaba implements sophisticated anti-whale mechanisms designed to protect regular investors while maintaining market liquidity and trading freedom. These mechanisms are carefully balanced to prevent market manipulation without restricting normal trading activity.

## Key Points for Investors

### üí° Your Funds Are Not Locked
- Regular investors (holding < 0.2% of pool) can trade freely
- Standard 2% fee applies to normal transactions
- No cooldown periods for regular-sized trades
- Full access to all trading features

### üêã Progressive Restrictions

#### Transaction Size Limits
| Trade Size (% of Pool) | Fee | Cooldown | Max Daily Volume |
|------------------------|-----|----------|------------------|
| < 0.2% | 2% | None | No limit |
| 0.2% - 0.5% | 3% | 5 minutes | 5% of pool |
| 0.5% - 1.0% | 4% | 15 minutes | 3% of pool |
| > 1.0% | 5% | 30 minutes | 1% of pool |

### üìä Impact Analysis
For perspective, with a $10M liquidity pool:
- Regular traders ($20k or less) = No restrictions
- Medium traders ($20k-$50k) = Minor fees
- Large traders ($50k-$100k) = Moderate restrictions
- Whale traders ($100k+) = Full restrictions

## Time-Based Protections

### Launch Phase (Days 1-60)
- Maximum sell order: 0.25% of liquidity
- Enhanced cooldown periods
- Stricter volume limits

### Growth Phase (Days 61-180)
- Maximum sell order: 0.5% of liquidity
- Standard cooldown periods
- Normal volume limits

### Mature Phase (180+ days)
- Maximum sell order: 0.75% of liquidity
- Reduced cooldown periods
- Relaxed volume limits

## Dynamic Adjustments

### Market Conditions
The system automatically adjusts restrictions based on:
- Current liquidity levels
- 24-hour trading volume
- Price volatility
- Market depth

### Emergency Controls
- Automatic circuit breakers for extreme volatility
- Community governance can adjust parameters

## Technical Implementation

```rust
// Example of trade validation logic
pub fn validate_trade(
    amount: u64,
    pool_size: u64,
    last_trade_time: i64
) -> Result<()> {
    let trade_percentage = (amount * 100) / pool_size;
    
    match trade_percentage {
        0..=20 => Ok(()), // Regular trades pass
        21..=50 => validate_medium_trade(last_trade_time),
        51..=100 => validate_large_trade(last_trade_time),
        _ => validate_whale_trade(last_trade_time)
    }
}
```
