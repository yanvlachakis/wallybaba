# WallyBaba Governance System

## Overview

The WallyBaba governance system empowers token holders to participate in protocol decision-making through a transparent and secure voting mechanism. This document outlines the core components and processes of our governance system.

## Governance Rights

### Participation Eligibility
- Must hold LP tokens
- Voting power proportional to LP tokens held
- Time-weighted voting power based on holding duration

### Votable Parameters
- Protocol parameters (fees, thresholds, cooldowns)
- Emergency actions
- System upgrades
- Treasury allocations

## Proposal Types

### 1. Standard Proposals
- 7-day discussion period
- 5-day voting period
- 72-hour execution timelock
- Requires 5% quorum
- Simple majority to pass

### 2. Emergency Proposals
- No discussion period
- 24-hour voting period
- No execution delay
- Requires 10% quorum
- 66% majority to pass

### 3. Technical Proposals
- 7-day discussion period
- 21-day voting period
- 72-hour execution timelock
- Requires 15% quorum
- 75% majority to pass

## Proposal Process

### 1. Submission Requirements
- Minimum 0.1% of total supply to submit
- Detailed implementation plan
- Clear success metrics
- Impact analysis

### 2. Discussion Phase
- Community feedback
- Technical review
- Parameter adjustments
- Documentation updates

### 3. Voting Phase
- One token = one vote
- Time-weighted multiplier
- No vote delegation
- Real-time results

### 4. Execution Phase
- Timelock period
- Automated execution
- Result verification
- Event logging

## Emergency Controls

### Conditions for Emergency Actions
- Severe market volatility
- Security threats
- Technical failures
- Regulatory compliance

### Emergency Action Types
- Trading pause
- Parameter adjustment
- Contract upgrades
- Fund protection

### Emergency Process
1. Emergency proposal creation
2. 24-hour voting period
3. Immediate execution if passed
4. Post-action review

## Governance Dashboard

### Features
- Proposal tracking
- Voting interface
- Analytics dashboard
- Historical records

### Metrics Tracked
- Participation rate
- Proposal success rate
- Voter distribution
- Time-weighted statistics

## Best Practices

### For Proposal Creators
1. Research thoroughly
2. Engage community early
3. Provide clear documentation
4. Be responsive to feedback

### For Voters
1. Review proposals carefully
2. Consider long-term impact
3. Participate in discussions
4. Monitor execution

## Technical Implementation

### Voting Power Calculation
```rust
fn calculate_voting_power(
    token_amount: u64,
    holding_duration: i64
) -> u64 {
    let base_power = token_amount;
    let time_multiplier = match holding_duration {
        d if d >= 180 days => 2.0,
        d if d >= 90 days => 1.5,
        d if d >= 30 days => 1.25,
        _ => 1.0
    };
    
    (base_power as f64 * time_multiplier) as u64
}
```

### Proposal Validation
```rust
fn validate_proposal(
    proposal_type: ProposalType,
    proposer_balance: u64,
    total_supply: u64
) -> Result<()> {
    let min_balance = match proposal_type {
        ProposalType::Standard => total_supply / 1000, // 0.1%
        ProposalType::Emergency => total_supply / 500,  // 0.2%
        ProposalType::Technical => total_supply / 200   // 0.5%
    };
    
    require!(
        proposer_balance >= min_balance,
        "Insufficient balance for proposal"
    );
    
    Ok(())
}
```
